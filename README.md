Reddit API 



Should be just plug and play, works for any known subreddits, just breaks if you put a fake one in or nothing as you are breaking promises.
If you select the same subreddit/a different one it will just add more results to the page and sort them to the highest upvoted ones first.

currently trying to find a solution to login in with reddit/ be able to create a post and upvote/downvote in Javascript
